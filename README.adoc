= Asciidoctor Gradle Plugin: Example Project

IMPORTANT: This repository is now out of date.
The official repository containing examples for the Asciidoctor Gradle plugin is https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-example.

An example project that demonstrates the use of the Asciidoctor Gradle Plugin.
The project also includes an example of an Asciidoctor extension written in _Groovy_.

== How to build the project

 $ ./gradlew asciidoctor

That's it.
Seriously.

NOTE: Move buildSrc to buildSrc.bak to try without loading the Asciidoctor extensions.
